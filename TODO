 * Support multinode test environment.
   Depends on: https://github.com/test-kitchen/test-kitchen/issues/873
   Affected use cases:
    - manageiq_key import - requires initialized server to import keys from
 * Avoid using 'pause', the modules should finish when the system is ready
   for next operation.
 * Fix idempotency of modules
